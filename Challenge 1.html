        <p> The <em>Polar Bear</em> is awesome because <strong></strong>.</p>

        <p> They roam the Arctic ice sheets and swim in that region's coastal waters. <br>
            They are very strong swimmers, and their large front paws, which they use to <br>
            paddle, are slightly webbed. Some polar bears have been seen swimming hundreds of <br>
            miles from land—though they probably cover most of that distance by floating on sheets of ice.

        <strong>Arctic Adaptations</strong>

        <br>
        Polar bears live in one of the planet's coldest environments and depend on a thick coat of <br>
        insulated fur, which covers a warming layer of fat. Fur even grows on the bottom of their paws, which <br>
        protects against cold surfaces and provides a good grip on ice. The bear's stark white coat provides <br>
        camouflage in surrounding snow and ice. But under their fur, polar bears have black skin—the better to <br>
        soak in the sun's warming rays.

        <strong>Hunting</strong>

        <br>
        These powerful predators typically prey on seals. In search of this quarry they frequent areas of <br>
        shifting, cracking ice where seals may surface to breathe air. They also stalk ice edges and breathing <br>
        holes. If the opportunity presents itself, polar bears will also consume carcasses, such as those of dead <br>
        whales. These Arctic giants are the masters of their environment and have no natural enemies.

        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>Breeding and Behavior</strong>

        <br>
        Females den by digging into deep snow drifts, which provide protection and insulation from the Arctic <br>
        elements. They give birth in winter, usually to twins. Young cubs live with their mothers for some 28 months <br>
        to learn the survival skills of the far north. Females aggressively protect their young, but receive no help <br>
        from their solitary male mates. In fact, male polar bears may even kill young of their species. <br>
        <br>
        Polar bears are attractive and appealing, but they are powerful predators that do not typically fear humans, <br>
        which can make them dangerous. Near human settlements, they often acquire a taste for garbage, bringing bears <br>
        and humans into perilous proximity.</p>
